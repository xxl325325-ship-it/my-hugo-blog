## 👩‍👧‍👦 我的故事 / My Story


我是两个孩子的妈妈，小城不擅长做题的生活家。本科毕业后在北京工作20年，如今带着全家老小搬到苏州，开启全新的生活篇章。

从职场精英到生活艺术家，从北漂到苏州新市民，每一步都是对生活的重新定义。我相信人生不是标准答案，而是不断探索的过程。


I am a mother of two children, a life artist who isn't good at standardized tests. After graduating from university, I worked in Beijing for 20 years. Now I've moved my entire family to Suzhou to start a brand new chapter of life.

From a career professional to a life artist, from a Beijing drifter to a new Suzhou resident, every step represents a redefinition of life. I believe life isn't about standard answers, but about continuous exploration.
